# AlternativeBowapJS
An alternative to jawsawn's BowapJS, with different implementation but a fair amount of shared code. Published with his permission, on the condition that I link his repo: https://github.com/jawsawn/bowapJS

The main difference is that jawsawn's BowapJS uses a sinusoidal angle over time, while this version uses a quadratic angle over time. There are some other minor differences as well.
